# Wireless-System-Simulation
In this project a wireless system with a base station is simulated and some parameters are calculated.

This project consist of 2 sections. Each section is described below.

- Section 1
    * In this section according to different types of available fading, the channel is simulated and some parameters regarding the received power and ... are  
       calcaulated.
    * Coverage area for the base station is calculated.

- Section 2
    * In this section a multi-path wireless system is simulated.
    * Assuming the channel is wideband, frequency response is calculated.
    * Assuming the channel is narrowband, doppler effect is taken into consideration for a receiver in motion and simulation is conducted.
